# Personal Portfolio Application

## Overview

This is a modern, full-stack personal portfolio website built for Ahana Kulkarni, showcasing multi-disciplinary creative work in UI/UX Design, Frontend Development, and Scriptwriting. The application features a sophisticated React frontend with advanced animations, a Node.js/Express backend, and PostgreSQL database integration using Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: GSAP for complex animations and interactive effects
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless adapter
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type validation

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations with automatic schema generation
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon serverless connection pooling

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication system (username/password)
- **Contact Submissions**: Contact form data with project type, budget, and details
- **Portfolio Projects**: Project showcase with categories, technologies, and featured flags
- **Blog Posts**: Content management with categories, tags, and publishing dates

### Frontend Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Advanced Animations**: GSAP-powered scroll animations, 3D effects, and interactive cursors
- **Dark/Light Theme**: System preference detection with manual toggle
- **Contact Forms**: Multi-step form with validation and submission handling
- **Portfolio Gallery**: Filterable project showcase with category-based navigation
- **Blog System**: Content display with reading time estimates and categorization

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/contact` - Contact form submission
- `GET /api/portfolio` - Retrieve all portfolio projects
- `GET /api/portfolio/featured` - Get featured projects only
- `GET /api/blog` - Blog post retrieval with filtering capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query for server state
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests with validation
3. **Business Logic**: Storage layer abstracts database operations
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes type-safe SQL queries
5. **Response Flow**: JSON responses flow back through the same layers

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **gsap**: Animation library for advanced effects
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router
- **zod**: Runtime type validation

### UI/UX Libraries
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **lucide-react**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Build tool with HMR support
- **typescript**: Static type checking
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Platform: Replit
- **Development Only**: Pure Vite React development server
- **Build Process**: Simple `vite build` for static files (not used in dev)
- **Port Configuration**: Vite dev server on port 5000
- **No Backend**: Completely static frontend application
- **No Database**: All data is static/hardcoded in components
